# Pandas Challenge

**Summary of the analysis**

In this assignment, I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to examine school and standardized test data. 
The first task was to analyze the district-wide standardized test results (math and reading scores) to showcase trends in school performance.
I built a high-level snapshot of the district's key metric in a DataFrame that includes:

* Total number of unique schools
* Total students
* Total budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* The percentage of students who passed math
* The percentage of students who passed reading
* The rate of students who passed math and reading

Then, I created a new DataFrame for the above calculations called `district_summary`.
At this point, I created another DataFrame that summarized crucial metrics about each school, including:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* The percentage of students who passed math
* The percentage of students who passed reading
* The rate of students who passed math and reading. 

I recapped the results in `per_school_summary`.
Also, in `top_school`, I displayed the top 5 schools where students passed math and reading.
In `bottom_school`, I displayed the lowest-performing school.
Then, I calculated the average math and reading score for students of each grade level (from 9th to 12th grade).
Also, to individuate a possible trend, I created a table that broke down school performance based on average spending ranges per student. I displayed the result in `spending_summary`, which included:

* Average math score
* Average reading score
* The percentage of students who passed math
* The percentage of students who passed reading
* The rate of students who passed both math and reading
 
Besides, in `size_summary`, I showed school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
Lastly, in `type_summary`, I displayed performance based on the school type. 

**Conclusion:**
